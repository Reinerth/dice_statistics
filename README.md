# dice_statistics :game_die:

I was curious to see what the probabilities of rolling a dice are,  
depending on the number of attempts/trials.   

With this little script we can see, quite good,  
that the more often we roll the dice,  
the lower is the difference of the probability 
of the numbers of the dice, from one to six. 

I used an Object-Literal-Pattern for this.

**Usage:** <br>
Just open the file in *Edge* (Only tested with ***Microsoft Edge***) <br>
enter in the *inputfield* the number of dice/attemps/trials <br>
and click the button ***dice*** <br>
<br>
**See screenshots below:**
